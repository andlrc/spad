STYLE GUIDE:

	1) Indentation
		Tabs are 8 characters, and thus indentation are also are also 8
		characters.

	2) Breaking long lines and string
		The limit on the length of lines is 80 columns and this is 
		strongy preferred limit.

		Statements longer than 80 columns will be broken into sensible
		chunks, unless exceeding 80 columns significantly increases the
		readability and does not hide information.

	In general sticking to GNU's indent with the following flags should
	be sufficient:

		$ indent -kr -i8 file...
